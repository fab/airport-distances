Airport Distances
========
This is a simple Ruby script that calculates the distance of all the [60 busiest US airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_the_United_States#Busiest_US_airports_by_total_passenger_boardings) from each of the [American Airlines hubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines#Current_hubs).

Results are in [distances.csv](distances.csv) with distance measured in miles.
